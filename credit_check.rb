# Problem: Determine the validity of a credit card number according to the Luhn Algorithm
#
# 1. Transform the card number (card_number) string to an array (split the numbers into individual items in the array)
# so that I can work with the individual positions in the array (numbers). Name the new array (individual_numbers).
#
# 2. Then transform the array's contents from strings to integers so that we can do some math. Name this
# integer array something new (individual_integers).
#
# 3. split the even position integers from the odd. Create new files for odd (doubles) vs even (singles).
#
# 4. Double each number in the doubles array and name the new array (doubled).
#
# 5. Find every digit in the Doubled array that is greater than 9 (which will yield a 2-digit number) and add the
# two digits together (i.e. 12 is 1+2 = 3). Actually, no, just subtract 9 instead to get the same number.
# call this new array doubled_subtracted.
#
# 6. Find the sum of all numbers in the doubleds_subtracted array. Call this new array doubleds_sum
# 
# 7. Find the sum of all numbers in the singles array, call the new array singles_sum
#
# 8. Add singles_sum and doubled_sum. Print the total sum of the two arrays.
#
# 9. Determine the total sum number modulo 10. If the result is 0, the account number is valid according to
# the algorithm.
